After unzipping the zip file, we find two files:bcache24.bmc, and Cache0000.bin .If we investigated the files by: file *, we see that bcache24.bmc is empty while Cache0000.bin is not. We will use this tool to analyze the .bin file: https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/bmc-tools.

After downloading the tool, we will do the following: sudo python ./bmc-tools.py -s Cache0000.bin -d ./ -v -o -b -w 100.

This will result in extracting 1161 images that we can view. These images has evidence of what happened and we can also get the flag from them.

Flag: HTB{w47ch_y0Ur_c0Nn3C71}.
