Description:A client reported that a PC might have been infected, as it's running slow. We've collected all the evidence from the suspect workstation, and found a suspicious trace of USB traffic. Can you identify the compromised data?

After unzipping the file, we see that we have a Wireshark file that we can investigate.

After investigating the Wireshark file we see that the traffic was captured is USB protocol. 

We will only investigate the URB_INTERRUPT in packets by highlighting these packets and export selected packets to a spereate file. These packets are keyboard strokes.

Note: make sure to check selected packets only when exporting the packets.

We will use the following tool to read the keyboard strokes: https://github.com/carlospolop-forks/ctf-usb-keyboard-parser.

We will use the tool as the following: tshark -r (the filtered packets file name) -Y 'usb.capdata && usb.data_len == 8' -T fields -e usb.capdata | sed 's/../:&/g2' > output.txt

Then, python3 usbkeyboard.py output.txt 



We will get the following output:⇪htb{⇪i_⇪c4n_533_⇪y⇪ou⇪r_⇪k3y2⇪}. However, this is not an acceptable flag. 

To get the flag, we will deal with the up arrows as caps lock on or off. So, 'htb' becomes 'HTB' and 'i' is still i as every second apperance of the up arrow is caps lock off.

flag: HTB{i_C4N_533_yOUr_K3Y2}
