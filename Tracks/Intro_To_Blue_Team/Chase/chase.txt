We download the zip file and we unzip it using the password provided.

After unzipping the file, we will get a file called chase.pcapng which we can open using Wireshark.

We will use the filter bar tool by typing: http.

This will give us only traffic that happened using http protocol.

The first result we get is a GET request from 22.22.22.7 and going to 22.22.22.5 .

We need to investigate this more. We right click on that request and we choose follow, then TCP stream.

We will be provided with a page of more info about this traffic. Client highlited in red and server highlited in blue.

From what we see, the client (in this case the attacker), accessed the upload page (upload.aspx).  

The attacker had admin privileges. This can be known from these two pieces of info:

-----------------------------240279915540934710361858528148
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="authKey"

admin
-----------------------------240279915540934710361858528148
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="cmd.aspx"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

This also shows that the filename that the attcker wanted to upload a file called cmd.aspx.

Using the cmd.aspx file, the attacker tried to upload nc64.exe file to the machine that is hosting the webserver. This is a netcat file which can be used by the attacker to start a reverse shell to the machine.

After successfully uploading the netcat file, once again, the attacker used the cmd.aspx file to run the netcat file to listen on the attacker ip address using the port 4444. 

The attacker has successfully accessed the machine. 

Now, we know the port that the attacker used to connect to the machine. We will use this info to continue investigating.

On the filter bar, we type: tcp.port==4444. This will give us the traffic that happened in that port.

We investigate the first stream as we did earlier. We find the commands that the attacker was typing on his/her target machien highlited in blue, and the victime machine in red.

The attacker wanted to know what user he/she is logged in as in the victime machine by typing whoami, the machine responded: iis apppool\defaultapppool, which is the user name. 

The attacker then typed the following: ipconfig, maybe to enumeratet the machine using network. 

The attacker then changed directory to C. Then, the attacker tried twice to upload a file from his/her machine to the C:\users\public directory under the name of file.txt, once using powershell command and the once with cmd command. However, both tries failed.

Getting flag:

The file name is :JBKEE62NIFXF6ODMOUZV6NZTMFGV6URQMNMH2IBA.txt which is base 32 . We decode it and we get: HTB{MAn_8lu3_73aM_R0cX}
