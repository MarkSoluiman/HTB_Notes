First,we start with Nmap scan: sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- --min-rate 5000 (target ip)

We find three tcp ports open: 21,80,2222

21/tcp is interesting as it is a FTP server and it allows anonymous login, so we try to login: ftp (target ip) with credentials: anonymous:(any random text as password).

We login and we see only one directory we can go to with only one file. We read the file and it is a message to someone called mitch. 

We know from the message that Mitch has set up a weak password for the system user and for something else, maybe for admin.

Now, lets focous on the port 80 which we know it is a website. We search the target ip and we see apache2 default page.

This is not very useful so we try dirbuster on this URL. We open dirbuster and we use a word list from /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster . 

After running for few minutes, dirbuster comes up with a directory called simple, so we search (target ip)/simple .

We are welcomed by a webpage for CMS made simple which is an open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to build and manage websites without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

Also, dirbuster came up with another directory called admin/login.php . If we searched that, we will see a login form. a SQLi attack may be the way to go.

We try SQLi manually but with nothing in return. We search for the technology name in the exploit database: searchsploit CMS Made Simple. 

Indeed we find multiple exploits but one is about SQLi. We search this exploit and it is a python file that uses a wordlist like rockyou.txt find the password and the username

We download the python file into our machine(https://github.com/e-renna/CVE-2019-9053/blob/master/exploit.py) .

However, this program works with a wordfile that is in UTF-8 and rockyou.txt is in latine-1. To fix this problem,we need to convert rockyou.txt to UTF-8 file and we can easily do that by: iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 rockyou.txt > rockyou_utf8.txt .

We will use the explit like this: python3 (python file name) -u (target ip/simple) -w (rockyou_uft8.txt) -c . This will take time to finish.

The tool only got me the hash of the password, so I googled the hash code that I got and the password is secret.

The username is mitch and the password is secret. 

If we try that, we will be let in.

As we knew from that message that we obtained earlier, we know that the same credentials will work if we tried to optain a secure shell using ssh, so we try that: ssh mitch@(target ip) -p 2222.

We are in.

We optian the user flag: G00d j0b, keep up!

Privilege Escalation:

We see what stuff we can run without being root: sudo -l.

We only can run vim. This is perfect.

We will use the shell escaping techinque to be root. All what we have to do is to run this command: sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'.

We are root. Now we can obtain the root flag. To find it: find / -name root.txt . 

root flag: W3ll d0n3. You made it!
