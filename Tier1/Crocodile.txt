As usual we start with scanning the target:

sudo nmap -sC -sV (target ip)

We can connect to this ftp server anonymosly which doesnt required any credintials 

we connect to the server like so: ftp (target ip)

We need to provide the user name of anonymous to have an access.

To list the files inside, we use the command dir 

We find very interesting files: alloweduserlist and alloweduserlist.passwd.

We download them both by: get alloweduserlist and, get alloweduserlist.passwd

We get a list of usernames and passwords.

We try to login again to the ftp server by using one of these usernames. However, we cant since it is anonymous login only.

Back when we did our scan on the target, we noticed another open port that has an Apache server running on it.

If we searched our target ip, we will be greeted with a website.

We can use a handy plug-in called Wappalyzer that gives us the technology used on the website 

The plug-in shows us that this website uses php and Apache http server.

We can use gobuster tool to go through the directories.

  gobuster dir --url http://10.129.170.20/ --wordlist /home/kali/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php,html

  -x : File extension(s) to search for.

  We used the -x switch to only search for php and html files

  Soon enough, We can see that we get some good results. index.html and login.php gave us an http response of 200 (OK)

  We can try to access these directories in the website

  upon accessing the login.php directory, we are faced with a login form. We can try to login as admin using the 2 files from earlier
