As usual, we start our nmap scan: sudo nmap -sV -sC (target ip)

We can use the mysql command to interact with the mysql server that we found


Note that the MySQL clients usually authenticate with the service with a username/password combination.
However, it is essential to test for passwordless authentication, as there might be an intentional
misconfiguration in the service, which would allow personnel to easily log into the service during the
deployment stage of the project to easily interact with it before making it available to other colleagues. In
the present situation, an initial attempt can be to attempt a log-in as the root user, naturally having the
highest level of privileges on the system.

We try to connect to the mysql server with the username of root like so: mysql -h (target ip) -u root

-h : Connect to host.
-u : User for log-in if not current user.

These are the commands that we can use to navigate through the database:

SHOW databases; : Prints out the databases we can access.
USE {database_name}; : Set to use the database named {database_name}.
SHOW tables; : Prints out the available tables inside the current
database.
SELECT * FROM {table_name}; : Prints out all the data from the table {table_name}.

It is important to include ; at the end of each command
