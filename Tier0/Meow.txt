We scan our target ip with: sudo nmap -sV (target ip).

We find that a telnet server is open on port 23/tcp.

Telnet is an old service
used for remote management of other hosts on the network.

Usually, Telnet requires username and password for additional security. We can check by telnet (target ip).

Sometimes, some servers are badly configured and we can easily login with one of these usernames :root,admin,administrator... 

Using root as a username, we succesfully managed to login without a password.

We can interact with this server using linux commands since this server is running on linux. 

We list the files and directories using ls. Upon using ls, we found flag.txt. We get the content of this file by using cat flag.txt

flag: b40abdfe23665f766f9c61ecba8a4c19
