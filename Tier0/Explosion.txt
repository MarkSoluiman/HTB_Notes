Since Telnet was developed before the internet, it lacks any encryption and thus it lacks security and it is prone to attacks.

An alternative option to the telnet is SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) as it uses public-key encryption to verify the remote host's identity.

//Hacking


We can first try to form an RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) session with the target by not providing any additional information for any
switches other than the target IP address. This will make the script use your own username as the login
username for the RDP session, thus testing guest login capabilities.

xfreerdp /v:(target ip)

that didnt work. 

We can try the following :xfreerdp /v:(target ip) /cert:ignore /u:Administrator

/cert:ignore : Specifies to the scrips that all security certificate usage should be
ignored.
/u:Administrator : Specifies the login username to be "Administrator".

In this case, no password is required
