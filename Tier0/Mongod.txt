We will begin our scan as follows: nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -sV {target_IP}

-p- : This flag scans for all TCP ports ranging from 0-65535
-sV : Attempts to determine the version of the service running on a port
--min-rate : This is used to specify the minimum number of packets that Nmap should
send per second; it speeds up the scan as the number goes higher

We need to connect to the MongoDB server that is running on the target.

We needed to install MongoDB first.

Then we use this command to connect to the MongoDB server :./mongo mongodb://{target_IP}:(open port). The open port being 27017 in our case.

But first we need to change directory to usr/bin to be able to use mongodbd

After connection, we can show the databases present by : show dbs

Then we can shows the database by: use (database)

We see something that catches our eyes, a database called sensitive_information.

We select it by : use sensitive_information

We can view the collections by: show collections

We can see that there exists a single collection named flag . We can dump the contents of the documents
present in the flag collection by using the db.collection.find() command.
Let's replace the collection
name flag in the command and also use pretty() in order to receive the output in a beautified format.
