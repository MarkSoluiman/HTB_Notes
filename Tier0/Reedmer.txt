In-memory database like Redis, retrives data very fast from the RAM, making it ideal with websites that has lots of traffic. However, the data is stored for a short amount of time (max of hours).

This time we used nmap -p- -sV 10.129.60.61 to scan all 65,535 ports. This took long time so I made it faster to only scan the first 10000 ports by doing nmap -p1-10000 -sV 10.129.60.61.

We use redi-cli in this lab. To get the host, we do redis-cli -h (target ip)

We get info about the Redis server by doing: info. We get a huge output under multiple heads like #Server , and #Keyspace.

The keyspace section provides statistics on the main dictionary of each database. The statistics include the
number of keys, and the number of keys with an expiration.

In this case, we got a database that has an index of 0 and we can select it by doing: select 0

Furthermore, we can list all the keys present in the database using the command : keys *

This will give us the following list: 
1) "flag"
2) "temp"
3) "stor"
4) "numb"

We can access each key by doing: get "key"

for example, get flag
