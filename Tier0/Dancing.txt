SMB protocol: Server Message Block (TCP 445)

This allows an application (or the user of an application) can access files at a remote server,
along with other resources such as printers. Thus, a client application can read, create, and update files on
the remote server. It can also communicate with any server program that is set up to receive an SMB client
request.

An SMB-enabled storage on the network is called a share which can be accessed by clients with address of the server and proper credentials

We can communicate with a server that uses the SMB protocol by smbclient command

To get the shares available on a remote SMB server. We can do the command : smbclient -L (target ip)

A list of what we would see after the previous command : 

ADMIN$ - Administrative shares are hidden network shares created by the Windows NT family of
operating systems that allow system administrators to have remote access to every disk volume on a
network-connected system. These shares may not be permanently deleted but may be disabled.

C$ - Administrative share for the C:\ disk volume. This is where the operating system is hosted.

IPC$ - The inter-process communication share. Used for inter-process communication via named
pipes and is not part of the file system.

WorkShares - Custom share.

Trying to directly access a share (ADMIN$) by doing this:
smbclient \\\\(target ip)\\ADMIN$
