SMB protocol: Server Message Block (TCP 445)

This allows an application (or the user of an application) can access files at a remote server,
along with other resources such as printers. Thus, a client application can read, create, and update files on
the remote server. It can also communicate with any server program that is set up to receive an SMB client
request.

An SMB-enabled storage on the network is called a share which can be accessed by clients with address of the server and proper credentials

We can communicate with a server that uses the SMB protocol by smbclient command

To get the shares available on a remote SMB server. We can do the command : smbclient -L (target ip)

A list of what we would see after the previous command : 

ADMIN$ - Administrative shares are hidden network shares created by the Windows NT family of
operating systems that allow system administrators to have remote access to every disk volume on a
network-connected system. These shares may not be permanently deleted but may be disabled.

C$ - Administrative share for the C:\ disk volume. This is where the operating system is hosted.

IPC$ - The inter-process communication share. Used for inter-process communication via named
pipes and is not part of the file system.

WorkShares - Custom share.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//Hacking:

Trying to directly access a share (ADMIN$) by doing this:
smbclient \\\\(target ip)\\ADMIN$

That didnt work either.

We try this with C$, that also didnt work.

Final chance, we try WorkShares, which is seems to be manly maid.

Indeed, this worked as it didnt require password. We are now in the server and we can list the files using ls, change directories using cd and downloading files using get.

We will see the flag.txt file if we changed directories to James.P and typed this get flag.txt.

After downloading the file, we exit the server by typing exit.

We can see the flag.txt that we downloaded in the root directory in our machine.

flag: 5f61c10dffbc77a704d76016a22f1664
