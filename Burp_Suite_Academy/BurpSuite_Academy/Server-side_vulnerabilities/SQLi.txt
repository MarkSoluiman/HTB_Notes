Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data 

The wording in this lab is currently misleading. What we need to do is to show every product including not released products.

We can launch a SQLi attack using the url.

If we click on a category to be filtered, in the url we will see something like this: category=Lifestyle.

What we need to do is: category=Lifestyle' or 1=1 --

This will give us every product availabe because it will us every item in table products where category is Lifestyle. However, by adding or 1=1 --, it will ignore the first requirement and also it will ignore any thing after the 1=1 since we added -- which marks whatever comes after it as a comment.

//Lab Done.

Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass 

Simply, to pass this lab, we need to type the following in the username: administrator' -- 

It doesn't matter what we are going to type in the password field. This will allow us to login as administrator.

//Lab Done.
